The PQ60 Breakout board is a development board for pico-satellites. It connects to the PQ60 bus and breaks the signals into two headers. This allows for fast prototyping of new system boards.

Uses @Pinski1's [PQ60-Template](https://github.com/pinski1/PQ60-Template) as the starting point for the design.

##Features
* 2off 2x10way 0.1" pitch headers with the PQ60 signals
* 7x10way 0.1" pitch prototyping thru-hole grid
